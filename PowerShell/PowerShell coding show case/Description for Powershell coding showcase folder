This folder "PowerShell coding showcase" is a subfolder that is used to showcase some of my work samples that I have built using my coding skills.
The purpose of these work samples is to explain the projects that I have built and showcase my work to potential clients in the future. So, others can get an idea of the type of work I can do for them.
