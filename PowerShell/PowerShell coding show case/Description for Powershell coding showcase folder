This folder "PowerShell coding showcase" is a subfolder that is used to store all the video content that I have built to showcase my coding skills.
The purpose of these videos I have built is to explain the projects that I have built and showcase my work to potential clients in the future. So, others can get an idea of the type of work I can do for them.
