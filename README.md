# PowerShell-Portfolio
My portfolio of PowerShell work that I have done for companies. I have created a repository so that employers can see what type of work I am done previously. In addition, 
this portfolio is used for education purposes for my colleges, so that students can learn from my PowerShell Script that I have created and how it is applied to real-world projects for companies and organizations. Professors are more than welcome to use my PowerShell scripts and incorporate it into their course cirriculum.
